The baryonic in-medium widths and realparts in this directory have been calculated using the flags:

$barbar_barbar
use_ND_ND_model= .true.
NR_NR_massSHIFT= .true.
$end

This is what is used by default. In the directory "NDmodel_false" there is a version of these files which has been calculated with

$barbar_barbar
use_ND_ND_model= .false.
NR_NR_massSHIFT= .false.
$end

If you want to use these files, you have to copy them from "./NDmodel_false" to ".", overwriting the other files.
